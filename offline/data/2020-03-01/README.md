# Data Collection Notes

Date: March 1st, 2020\
Location: Building 21

## Session 1: Subject 004

### Electrodes

| Channel  |      1      |      2      |      3     |       4     |      5      |      6      |     7      |     8       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Location | Right thumb | Right index | Right ring | Right pinky | Left thumb  | Left index  | Left ring  | Left pinky  |

- Ground electrode on bone on back of forearm (near the wrist) (only one electrode, does not matter which arm)

### Trials
- Trial 1: Guided, keyboard
    - Participant typed on keyboard, following dashboard prompts
    - 8 fingers used (both hand, no thumbs)
    - Around 7 minutes

### Remarks
- We put some of the electrodes (pinky and index (?)) on the back of the forearm instead of inside.
  For this participant it worked better that way, and we saw activity when the finger was pulled back (second half of typing movement)
  
## Session 2: Subject 007

### Electrodes

| Channel  |      1      |      2      |      3     |       4     |      5      |      6      |     7      |     8       |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Location | Right thumb | Right index | Right ring | Right pinky | Left thumb  | Left index  | Left ring  | Left pinky  |

- Ground electrode on bone on back of forearm (near the wrist) (only one electrode, does not matter which arm)

### Trials
- Trial 1: Guided, keyboard
    - Participant typed on keyboard, following dashboard prompts
    - 8 fingers used (both hand, no thumbs)
- Trial 2: Self-directed
    - Participant typed whatever they wanted on the keyboard
    - All fingers used
        - The spacebar was pressed with both thumbs at the same time
- Trial 3: In the air
    - Participant typed in the air, following dashboard prompts
    - 8 fingers used (both hand, no thumbs)
- Trial 4: Self-directed
    - Participant typed whatever they wanted on the keyboard
    - All fingers used
        - The spacebar was pressed with both thumbs at the same time

### Remarks
- This participant has the best data for now, from what we could tell
- For Trial 2, there was a lag between the keypress and the recorded event showing up on the dashboard, 
  so maybe the timestamps are inaccurate.
- Realized halfway through Trial 4 that participant did not follow correct mapping for some keys
    - Typed "p" with right ring finger instead of right pinky
    - Typed "y" and "u" with a finger other than the right index finger (maybe used the right middle finger)
