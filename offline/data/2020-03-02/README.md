| Location | Right thumb | Right index | Right ring | Right pinky | Left thumb  | Left index  | Left ring  | Left pinky  |

- Ground electrode on bone on back of forearm (near the wrist), left arm

### Trials
- Trial 1: Guided, in the air
    - Participant typed on keyboard, following dashboard prompts
    - 8 fingers used (both hand, no thumbs)
    - Around 7 minutes
- Trial 2: Self-directed
    - Participant typed on table
        - Text: some sentences from a [BuzzFeed article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katherinemiller/amy-klobuchar-drops-out-ends-presidential-campaign)
    - Pressed spacebar with both thumbs at the same time

### Remarks
- Typing on the wireless keyboard produced weird data: movement from a finger on the left hand created pulses 
  in right hand channels.
- Participant typed most "c"s with index finger instead of middle finger
