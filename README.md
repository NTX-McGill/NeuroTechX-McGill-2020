# EMGeyboard

## What is the EMGeyboard?
The EMGeyboard is a novel control interface that allows users to type words without using a keyboard. It consists of two 3-piece armbands that record electromyography (EMG) signals from a user's forearm muscle activity. The data are wirelessly transmitted to a computer that processes them and converts them to finger movement predictions. Then, consecutive finger predictions are converted into the most likely word the user has typed. The finger movement predictions are visually communicated to the user through a web application, and the predicted words are sent to a Unity game environment, were we implemented a mail application and a music application.

## Why did we make it?
Artificial reality (AR) technologies open up a whole new realm of possibilities for human-computer interactions. However, most current AR interfaces require the use of specialized handheld controllers to interact with the virtual component of their environment. We set out to address this limitation by designing a device that would allow users to seemlessly transition between interacting with the physical world and interacting with the virtual world. AR interface users can wear our armbands and . Moreover, our device is low-cost: the armband pieces are 3D-printed, we use consumer-grade EMG equipement, and the software we created and/or used is freely available.
